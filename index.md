# Research, Development, and Innovation in Statistics Education (REDEVISE)

*March 24, 2025*


## Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE)

- <https://www.causeweb.org>
- U.S.-based organization whose mission is to support and advance undergraduate statistics education, in four target areas: resources, professional development, outreach, and research.
    - **eCOTS (electronic conference on teaching statistics)**: every two years; primary event is virtual but we also support regional in-person events paid for by sponsors and registration fees.
    - USCOTS (US Conference on Teaching Statistics)
    - **USPROC and eUSR**: project competition and a conference specifically for undergraduate students
    - Fun collection/caption contest/A-mu-sing contest/VOICES conference
    - Research Program: mini conferences, research reading groups, and new community building projects
    - CAUSE/ASA JEDI initiative
    - **SDSE Webinars**
    - Hosting SBI, STUB, TSHS, & Chance News portals

## Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE)

- Initiative supported by the American Statistical Association
- Website: <https://www.amstat.org/education/guidelines-for-assessment-and-instruction-in-statistics-education-(gaise)-reports>
    - Grade school (preK-12) and University (College) 
    - Revision (ongoing): <https://community.amstat.org/collegegaiserevision/revised-gaise-ten-recs>
    - Assessment Committee Work (Recc #9)



## 2025 Penn State Statistics Research Day

### Statistics & Data Science Education Research Interests

#### Educational Assessment

  - **developing and analyzing tools** intended to measure specific learning outcomes, etc. Novel approaches to educational measurement.
  - "tests" for research use across academic institutions; e.g., **intro data science**, intro **statistics**, **capstone assessment** just before graduation in statistics
  - formative assessment; e.g., feedback for self-regulated learning and/or adaptive instruction

#### Data Science Education

  - exploring intersection of stat education & computing education
  - studying **DS/CS topics introduced as learning objectives in statistics** curricula
  - Data literacy, data acumen, EDA for DS

#### Teaching & Learning

  - **mechanisms to promote efficient learning** outcomes
  - cognitive transfer, i.e., flexible/portable learning to be applied beyond the classroom
  - cognitive load, i.e., stresses on student bandwidth during learning processes
